# About Nginx: 
Nginx (pronounced "engine X") is a popular open-source web server software that is used for serving web pages to clients. It can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. Nginx is known for its high performance, stability, and low resource usage, and it has become a popular choice for serving web content on the internet. It can be used on Unix, Linux, and Windows platforms, and it supports many protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP. Nginx is also commonly used in conjunction with other web technologies such as PHP, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails just to name a few.
